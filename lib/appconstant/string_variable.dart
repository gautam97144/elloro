Any liability we do have for losses you suffer is strictly limited to losses that were reasonably foreseeable. For clarification, these terms do not limit Elloro's liability for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, death or personal injury to the extent that applicable law would prohibit such a limitation and for any other liability that, by applicable law, may not be limited or excluded.
You agree to indemnify and hold Elloro harmless from and against any reasonably foreseeable direct losses, damages, and reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) suffered or incurred by Elloro arising out of or related to: (1) your breach of any of these Terms (including any additional Elloro terms and conditions incorporated herein);  (2) any activity in which you engage on or through the Elloro Service; and (3) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.
These Terms are governed by and are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales. \n\n May 2022''';
